[section pstade::result_of]

[heading Description]
`boost::result_of` has some problems especially under Boost1.34 or below:

* `boost::result_of` can't take a /const-qualified function pointer/ as the target function.
* Under msvc-7.1 or msvc-8.0 with Boost1.34 or below, `boost::result_of` can't take a /POD/ template as the target function. 

[note If you already use Boost1.35 and don't pass a /const-qualified function pointer/, you don't need this workaround.]

[section detect_result_type.hpp]

[heading Description]
`BOOST_MPL_HAS_XXX_TRAIT_DEF`, which __BOOST_RESULT_OF__ and __BOOST_LAMBDA__ depend on,
sometimes fails to work under the msvc compilers.
When you see a weird error message such that
"nested `sig` template is undefined" or "nested `result` template is undefined",
use this header.

[heading Preconditions]

[section deduced_form]

[heading Description]
The overload resolution system of GCC 3.4.x or below is broken when you call the overloaded functions whose arity is the same with explicit template parameter types.
If you overload `call` in __BABY_FUNCTION__ with the same arity under GCC 3.4.x,
you must pass an extra parameter to __EGG_FUNCTION__ or __EGG_FUNCTION_FACADE__.
Then, the __BABY_FUNCTION__ interface is slightly changed.

[section DEFER]

[heading Description]
Under msvc-8.0, `boost::mpl::apply<PlaceholderExpression,..>` randomly fails
at the instantiation process in `boost::result_of`.
So that, `deferred` that depends on `boost::mpl::apply` needs a workaround.
